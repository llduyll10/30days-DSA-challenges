Given an array of integers, our task is to write a program that efficiently finds the second-largest element present in the array.

**Examples:**

- Input: arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
- Output: The second largest element is 34. Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34

- Input: arr[] = {10, 5, 10}
- Output: The second largest element is 5. Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5
